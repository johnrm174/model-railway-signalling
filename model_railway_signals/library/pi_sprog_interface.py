# This provides a basic CBUS interface fpor communicating with the Pi-SPROG3 via the Raspberry Pi 
# UART. It does not provide a fully-functional interface for all DCC command and control functions,
# just the minimum set needed to support the driving of signals and points via a selection of common
# DCC Accessory decoders. Basic CV Programming is also supported - primarily as an aid to testing. 
# For full decoder programming the recommendation is to use JRMI DecoderPro or similar.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Public Types and Functions:
# 
# sprog_connect - Open and configures the serial comms port to the Pi Sprog and issues
#                   a Request Command Station Status command to confirm connectivity
#    Optional Parameters:
#       port_name:str - The serial port to use for the Pi-SPROG 3 - Default="/dev/serial0",
#       baud_rate:int - The baud rate to use for the serial port - Default = 460800,
#       dcc_debug_mode:bool - Set to 'True' to log the CBUS commands being sent to the Pi-SPROG
#         returns True - if communications with the Pi-Sprog have been established (otherwise False)
#
# service_mode_read_cv - Queries a CV in direct bit mode and waits for response
#                       (events are only sent if the track power is currently switched on)
#                       (request times out after 5 secs if the request was unsuccessful)
#    Mandatory Parameters:
#       cv:int - The CV (Configuration Variable) to be read
#          returns the current value of the CV if a response is received
#          returns None - if the request fails or the request times out
# 
# service_mode_write_cv - programmes a CV in direct bit mode and waits for response
#                       (events are only sent if the track power is currently switched on)
#                       (request times out after 5 secs if the request was unsuccessful)
#    Mandatory Parameters:
#       cv:int - The CV (Configuration Variable) to be programmed
#       value:int - The value to programme
#          returns True - if we have acknowledgement that the CV has been programmed
#          returns False - if the CV programming fails or the request times out
# 
# request_dcc_power_on - sends request to switch on the power and waits for acknowledgement
#                  (requests only sent if the Comms Port has been successfully opened/configured)
#          returns True - if we have acknowledgement that Track Power has been turned on
#          returns False - if the request times out
# 
# request_dcc_power_off - sends request to switch off the power and waits for acknowledgement
#                  (requests only sent if the Comms Port has been successfully opened/configured)
#          returns True - if we have  acknowledgement that Track Power has been turned off
#          returns False - if the request times out
# 
# Functions are also included in the Code base for sending direct DCC accessory Packets
# and Extended DCC Accessory Packets. However, I have as yet been unable to get these
# Working with the Signallist SC1 Decoder - so these are unproven
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Note that the Pi-SPROG-3 needs the UART interfaces to be swapped so that
# serial0 is routed to the GPIO connector instead of being used for BlueTooth.
# The configuration procedure is documented below
#
# 1) Download the uart-rtscts overlay:
#    wget https://raw.github.com/HiassofT/AtariSIO/master/contrib/rpi/uart- ctsrts.dtbo
# 2) Copy it to the required directory:
#    sudo cp uart-ctsrts.dtbo /boot/overlays/
# 3) Add the overlays to the end of config.txt:
#    sudo nano /boot/config.txt - and then add the following lines:
#       dtoverlay=miniuart-bt
#       enable_uart=1
#       dtoverlay=uart-ctsrts
# 4) Edit the command line to prevent the Kernel using the UART at startup:
#    sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt 
#        Remove ‘console=serial0,115200’
#        Note that this file must contain only one line
# 5) Reboot the Raspberry Pi

# Function to encode a standard Extended DCC Accessory Decoder Packet into 4 bytes
# for transmission to the PI-SPROG as a RDCC4 Command (Request 4-byte DCC Packet).
# Calls the 'send_cbus_command' function to actually encode and send the command
# The DCC Packet is sent <repeat> times - but not refreshed on a regular basis
# Acknowledgement to Java NMRA implementation (which this function follows closely)
#
# Packets are represented by an array of bytes. Preamble/postamble not included.
# From the NMRA RP:  10AAAAAA 0 0AAA0AA1 0 000XXXXX 0 EEEEEEEE 1}
#    A = Address bits
#    X = The Aspect to display
#    E = the error detection bits
#
# The addressing is not clear in te NRMA standard - Two interpretations are provided
# in the code (albeit one commented out) - thanks again to the Java NMRA implementation
#
# NOTE - This function is currently untested as I have been unable to confirm
# (either via research or Test) whether the Pi-SPROG-3 supports the RDDC4 Command
