# The schedule_task class is used to schedule the other functions at a point in the
# futurewhen the set_schematic_route and clear_schematic route functions are run.
# Note we only run the tasks if we are still in RUN MODE. The exception to this is
# complete_route_cleardown where we could be doing this after switching to EDIT Mode
#
# After each change, we call the appropriate event callback function in run layout to
# complete the required processing (interlocking, aspect updates etc) to preserve the
# overall integrity of the layout configuration. We pass the optional 'route_id' into
# these functions so this can be forwarded to the various "check routes are still valid"
# functions in this module - This is so any changes required to set up or clear down a
# route won't trigger a route re-set - eg set FPL off before changing a point
