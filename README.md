# model-railway-signalling

A DCC model railway signalling application written in Python, enabling automated and interlocked layout 
signalling schemes to be designed and configured via the UI without the need to write any code. The
application is primarily intended for the Raspberry Pi, but will also run on other platforms (albeit 
without some of the Raspberry-Pi specific interfacing functions). 

* Enables layout schematics to be created with signals, points, track sections and block instruments.
* Supports most types of UK colour light signals, semaphore signals, and ground signals.
* Interfaces with the Pi-SPROG DCC command station to drive the signals and points out on the layout.
* Uses the Raspberry Pi GPIO inputs to provide train detection in support of signalling automation.
* Incorporates MQTT networking to allow multiple signalling applications to be linked for larger layouts.
* Provides a [Public API](https://github.com/johnrm174/model-railway-signalling/blob/main/PUBLIC_API.md) 
to support custom layout control interfaces.

Configured / pre-installed systems are now available to purchase from:
[https://www.model-railway-signalling.co.uk/](https://www.model-railway-signalling.co.uk/)
The website also included a number of user guides that can be downloaded (in PDF format).

My youTube channel also has a number of videos demonstrating the use of the application:

## What's new for Release 4.7.0:

* Track Sections, Track Sensors and Text Boxes can be hidden in RUN Mode if required - this enables the
schematic to be annonated with design notes in Edit Mode (which are then hidden in Run Mode). Also
provides flexibility for implementing other niche automation use cases on your layout.
* Ability to set the background colour of Text Boxes to 'Transparent (i.e. no fill colour)
* Point/signal button sizes can be changed via general settings (aids selection via touchscreen monitors)
* The colour of the Schematic Route buttons can now be set by the user (for differentiating route groups)
* Setup of Schematic Routes can now be triggered from Track Sensors (useful for converging routes)
* Bugfix to schematic editor - to prevent right mouse clicks whilst object moves ae in progress

## Installing the application

For a first time installation use:
<pre>
$ pip install model-railway-signals             <== This should work for most python installations
or
$ python -m pip install model-railway-signals   <== If the command line version of pip is not installed/enabled
or
$ python3 -m pip install model-railway-signals  <== If you have multiple major versions of python installed
</pre>
When installing the application on later versions of python you may get the following error:
<pre>
error: externally-managed-environment
</pre>
To overcome this, add the '--break-system-packages' argument to the command - e.g.
<pre>
$ pip install --break-system-packages model-railway-signals 
</pre>
<pre>
$ sudo mv /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED.old
</pre>
To upgrade to the latest version use:
<pre>
$ pip install --upgrade model-railway-signals            <== This should work for most python installations
or
$ python -m pip install --upgrade model-railway-signals  <== If the command line version of pip is not installed/enabled
or
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade model-railway-signals <== If you have multiple major versions of python installed
</pre>
To remove the application:
<pre>
$ pip uninstall model-railway-signals                    <== This should work for most python installations
or
$ python -m pip uninstall model-railway-signals          <== If the command line version of pip is not installed/enabled
or
$ python3 -m pip uninstall model-railway-signals         <== If you have multiple major versions of python installed
</pre>
To install a specific version of the application the application:
<pre>
$ pip install model-railway-signals==4.5.0               <== This should work for most python installations
or
$ python -m pip install model-railway-signals==4.5.0     <== If the command line version of pip is not installed/enabled
or
$ python3 -m pip install model-railway-signals==4.5.0    <== If you have multiple major versions of python installed
</pre>
The application has minimum external dependencies (over and above the 'standard' python installation),
'pyserial' and 'paho-mqtt', both of which should automatically get installed with the application.
If for some reason this doesn't happen (I've been made aware of one instance on a Windows platform) then
these packages can be installed seperately (prior to installing the model-railway-signals package):
<pre>
$ pip install paho-mqtt
$ pip install pyserial
</pre>
If you want to use Block Instruments with full sound enabled (bell rings and telegraph key sounds)
then you will also need to install the 'simpleaudio' package. If 'simpleaudio' is not installed then 
the application will still function correctly (just without sound).
<pre>
$ pip install simpleaudio
</pre>
If you are running on a later version of Python you may need to install libasound2 before the simpleaudio pip install will work.
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
</pre>
Note that for Windows, the 'simpleaudio' it has a dependency  on Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater 
(so you will need to ensure Visual Studio 2015 is installed first).


## Running the application

The python package should be run as a module (note underscores):
<pre>
$ python -m model_railway_signals  <== This should work for most python installations
or
$ python3 -m model_railway_signals <== If you have multiple major versions of python installed
</pre>
If required, a layout schematic can be loaded at startup:
<pre>
$ python -m model_railway_signals -f layout_file.sig
</pre>
If required, the logging level can be specified at startup (ERROR, WARNING, INFO or DEBUG)
<pre>
$ python -m model_railway_signals -f layout_file.sig -l DEBUG
</pre>

And finally, a top tip for running the application on the latest Debian Bookworm release which uses Wayland as the GUI backend
rather than X11 (which was the backend for previous Debian releases). I found that with Wayland, the Tkinter GUI performance
was terrible for some reason (not just my application - python/Tkinter performance in general) - and that was running on a
Raspberry Pi 5 which I would have expected to improve overall performance. Anyway, I found that the fix is to switch the GUI
backend of the Raspberry Pi back to X11 - performance of the user interface is now lightning quick!

To change the backend - Run "sudo raspi-config", select 'Advanced Options' then 'Wayland' and select X11.

An additional benifit was that some of the other applications I use (such as the kazam video capture software)
will now work as normal on the Raspberry Pi 5.
